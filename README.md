Chromium theme that is inspired by the Atom One Dark Theme created by Mahmoud Ali (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/akamud). The goal is to create a more visually appealing dark theme for Chromium Browsers. 
Atom one Dark has a good visual balance that does not cause me eye strain so I wanted to bring this to the browser.
